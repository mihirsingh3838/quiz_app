# Quiz App

This is my second flutter project in which i have created a mobile app which can take a small quiz regarding flutter and display the final output as how many answers where correct and how many where wrong.

## Getting Started

In case someone wants to run this app they should follow the given steps

1. Ensure that node, flutter, android studio, and all other necessary SDK are installed in their local system.
2. Find the lib folder in the project and open the main.dart file there.
3. If you are using VsCode as IDE, use the shortcut (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and type "select device" in the search bar.
4. Select your emulator device.
5. Run the shortcut (CTRl+F5) in order to run without debugging your application.
